Agario Checkers
===============

Checkers-like game with inspiration from agar.io

Running
-------

Agario Checkers uses the LÖVE 2D game engine. It must be installed to run the
game. On Debian-based operating systems, this can be done with

    # apt-get install love

With LÖVE installed, you can start the game in two ways. The first is to use
the current working directory:

    $ love .

The other is to run a packaged version of the game. See below for details.

Packaging
---------

One of the conveniences of LÖVE is its simple packaging system. A runnable
`love` file is simply a zip archive with the Lua sources inside it. A makefile
has been provided with this program to ease the packaging process. Simply
execute

    $ make

to zip up the sources and data files into a package. The resulting file will be
called `agario-checkers.love`, and it can be tested by running

    $ love agario-checkers.love

This package can then be sent to other computers as a standalone game file. Any
computer with the LÖVE engine installed can run the package, which makes this
game cross-platform as well.

Hacking
-------

Follow the conventions you see used throughout the source code. 3-space
indentation and 79-column limit with few exceptions. You may submit patches
through GitHub's pull request system or by [submitting them to Delwink][1].
